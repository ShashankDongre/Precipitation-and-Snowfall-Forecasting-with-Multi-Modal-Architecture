# Precipitation and Snowfall Forecasting with Multi-Modal Architecture
 Implemented a multi-modal architecture combining ConvLSTM and LSTM to enhance precipitation forecasting. This approach utilized satellite imagery and meteorological data, significantly improving prediction accuracy for Lake Michigan.

The Lake Effect Snowfall Prediction project is a research initiative aimed at predicting lake effect snowfall events originating from Lake Michigan. This weather phenomenon impacts regions in Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. Our project utilizes a diverse dataset collected from two distinct sources: ground-based weather stations and satellite imagery. The combination of these datasets allows for a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric conditions leading to lake effect snowfall.
