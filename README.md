# Precipitation and Snowfall Forecasting with Multi-Modal Architecture

**Objective**: This project implemented a multi-modal architecture combining ConvLSTM and LSTM to enhance precipitation forecasting using satellite imagery and meteorological data. This approach significantly improved prediction accuracy for Lake Michigan.

## Project Overview
The Lake Effect Snowfall Prediction project aims to predict lake effect snowfall events originating from Lake Michigan. This weather phenomenon impacts regions in Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. By combining datasets from ground-based weather stations and satellite imagery, the project seeks a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric conditions leading to lake effect snowfall.

## Key Areas Explored
- **Data Integration**: Ground-based and satellite data were combined to gain a detailed understanding of complex weather dynamics contributing to lake effect snowfall.

- **Feature Selection**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing identified critical weather attributes, enabling efficient feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

- **Model Diversity**: Experimented with a variety of machine learning models to assess their suitability for different forecasting scenarios.

- **Hybrid Models**: A hybrid neural network model demonstrated the value of combining ConvLSTM and LSTM architectures, leveraging complementary strengths.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel, IDE
